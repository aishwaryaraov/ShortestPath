# RouteOptimizer
Develop an algorithm for providing an optimized short route on path with traffic for a traveler to reach from source to destination. 
This is a core java application that gives the shortest path from all sources to all the destinations in terms of distance based on a pre-defined formula. 
The input of all paths is taken from an input file and output is given in the form of a matrix.
This application uses and iterates extensively with Array data structure.
Successfully implemented the project on Eclipse IDE.
